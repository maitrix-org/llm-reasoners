# Instructions
Describe the action the assistant should take next to carry out the user's instruction. Avoid using phrases such as "To accomplish the goal," "I will," "To proceed.". Avoid ending with phrases like "to execute the search." Describe one action at a time and avoid combining multiple steps. Refrain from mentioning specific element IDs as they may change during execution. Limit your response to one phrase and include any details that help select the correct action. Be creative and propose novel methods to achieve the goal. Avoid creating accounts without user permission or providing personal information. Concrete example would be "Go to the home page of Google Flights." and "Click on the 'Search' button."

Wrap your response in the following format:

<think>
Your thoughts and reasoning process
</think>

<intent>
Description of the action to perform next
</intent>

## AXTree:
Note: [bid] is the unique alpha-numeric identifier at the beginning of lines for each element in the AXTree. Always use bid to refer to elements in your actions.

Note: You can only interact with visible elements. If the "visible" tag is not
present, the element is not visible on the page.

RootWebArea 'Login User Task', focused
	[14] paragraph '', visible
		[15] LabelText '', visible
			StaticText 'Username'
		[16] textbox '', clickable, visible
	[17] paragraph '', visible
		[18] LabelText '', visible
			StaticText 'Password'
		[19] textbox '', clickable, visible
	[20] button 'Login', clickable, visible

## Focused element:
bid='9'


# History of interaction with the task:

# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them
are python function executing playwright code. The primary way of referring to
elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


11 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
mouse_move(x: float, y: float)
mouse_click(x: float, y: float, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left')
mouse_dblclick(x: float, y: float, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left')
mouse_down(x: float, y: float, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left')
mouse_up(x: float, y: float, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left')
scroll(delta_x: float, delta_y: float)
click(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'ControlOrMeta', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])
keyboard_press(key: str)
keyboard_type(text: str)
fill(bid: str, value: str)
Only a single action can be provided at once. Example:
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])

Note: you are on mac so you should use Meta instead of Control for Control+C etc.

Note:
* Some tasks may be game like and may require to interact with the mouse position
in x, y coordinates.
* Some text field might have auto completion. To see it, you have to type a few
characters and wait until next step.
* If you have to cut and paste, don't forget to select the text first.
* Coordinate inside an SVG are relative to it's top left corner.
* Make sure to use bid to identify elements when using commands.
* Interacting with combobox, dropdowns and auto-complete fields can be tricky,
sometimes you need to use select_option, while other times you need to use fill
or click and wait for the reaction of the page.

# Current State:
The current state of the webpage is a login form titled "Login User Task." The form includes two input fields: one for the username (bid='16') and one for the password (bid='19'). Both fields are visible and clickable, allowing user input. There is also a "Login" button (bid='20') that is clickable and visible.

No errors have been encountered on the page, and there are no dialogs or progress indicators present. The webpage is currently focused on the login form, indicating that it is ready for user interaction. The previous action did not result in any significant changes to the webpage, as it remains in the same state with the login form displayed.

Inferred information suggests that the next step would involve entering credentials into the username and password fields and then clicking the "Login" button to proceed. However, no specific errors or issues have been reported at this stage.
