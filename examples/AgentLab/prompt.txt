# Instructions
Summarize the current state of the webpage observation, focusing on the most recent action you took and any errors encountered. Note any dialogs, progress indicators, or significant changes such as items in your cart or sites visited. Describe the impact of your previous action on the webpage, including any new interactive elements. Include any inferred information that may help achieve the goal. Information from steps earlier are for reference only. Focus on objective description of the current observation and any inferences you can draw from it. Report any error messages displayed. Do not include your next planned actions; focus solely on providing an objective summary.

Wrap your response in the tag <state> and </state>.
