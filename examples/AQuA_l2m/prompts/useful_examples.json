  "input": "Given a multiple choice question and all the options, please decompose the question into sub-questions. For each sub-question, please answer it in a complete sentence, ending with \"The answer is\". When the original question is answerable, please go through all the options and find the best option that is closest to the answer, the answer must be a letter choose from A to E, start the subquestion with \"Now we can answer the question: \", ending with \"The answer is\".\n\nQuestion 1: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is? Options: A) 50 B) 45 C) 65 D) 78 E) 64.\nQuestion 1.1: Total sum of the 15 numbers? \nAnswer 1.1: The average is 40, so the total sum is 15 * 40 = 600. The answer is 600.\nQuestion 1.2: Increase in the sum when 10 is added to each number? \nAnswer 1.2: The total sum increases by 15 * 10 = 150. The answer is 150.\nQuestion 1.3: New total sum after addition? \nAnswer 1.3: The new total sum is the original sum plus the increase: 600 + 150 = 750. The answer is 750.\nQuestion 1.4: New mean after addition? \nAnswer 1.4: The mean is calculated by 750/15 = 50. The answer is 50.\nQuestion 1.5: Now we can answer the question: which option corresponds to the new mean? \nAnswer 1.5: The new mean after adding 10 to each of the 15 numbers is 50. The answer is A.\n\nQuestion 2: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a. Options: A) 1/2 B) 3/2 C) 5/2 D) 4/2 E) 7/2.\nQuestion 2.1: How can we express b in terms of a? \nAnswer 2.1: We can express b as b = 4a/3. The answer is b = 4a/3.\nQuestion 2.2: The equation in terms of a only? \nAnswer 2.2: Substituting b = 4a/3 in to 8a + 5b = 22, we get: 8a + 5 * (4a/3) = 22, simplifying further: 44a/3 =22. The answer is 44a/3 = 22.\nQuestion 2.3: What is the value of a that satisfies the equation? \nAnswer 2.3: To find a, we'll rearrange the equation: a = 22*3/44, and get a = 3/2. The answer is a = 3/2.\nQuestion 2.4: Now we can answer the question: which option corresponds to the value of a? \nAnswer 2.4: The value of a that we calculated is 3/2. The answer is B.\n\nQuestion 3: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance? Options: A) 53 km B) 55 km C) 52 km D) 60 km E) 50 km.\nQuestion 3.1: What is the formula relating speed, time, and distance? \nAnswer 3.1: The formula is: distance = speed * time. The answer is: distance = speed * time.\nQuestion 3.2: What is the distance traveled? \nAnswer 3.2: We get: distance = 20 km/hr * 2.5 hr, so distance = 50 km. The answer is 50 km.\nQuestion 3.3: Now we can answer the question: which option corresponds to the distance traveled? \nAnswer 3.3: The calculated distance is 50 km. The answer is E.\n\nQuestion 4: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500? Options: A) 1156 B) 1392 C) 1480 D) 1562 E) 1788.\nQuestion 4.1: Keystrokes for one-digit numbers? \nAnswer 4.1: The numbers are from 1 to 9, which totals 9 keystrokes. The answer is 9.\nQuestion 4.2: Keystrokes for two-digit numbers? \nAnswer 4.2: The numbers range from 10 to 99, giving us 90 numbers. Each number requires 2 keystrokes, totaling 90 * 2 = 180 keystrokes. The answer is 180.\nQuestion 4.3: Keystrokes for three-digit numbers? \nAnswer 4.3: The numbers span from 100 to 500, which is 401 numbers. Each of these numbers requires 3 keystrokes, amounting to 401 * 3 = 1203 keystrokes. The answer is 1203.\nQuestion 4.4: What is the total number of keystrokes? \nAnswer 4.4: The total number of keystrokes is: 9 + 180 + 1203 = 1392. The answer is 1392.\nQuestion 4.5: Now we can answer the question: which option corresponds to the total number of keystrokes needed to type numbers from 1 - 500? \nAnswer 4.5: The total number of keystrokes needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500 is 1392. The answer is B.\n\n",
