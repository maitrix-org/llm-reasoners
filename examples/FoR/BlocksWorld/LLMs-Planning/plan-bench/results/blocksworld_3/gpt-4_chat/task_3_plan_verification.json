A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the blue block. \nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the orange block from on top of the red block\nput down the orange block\nunstack the red block from on top of the blue block\nput down the red block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the blue block\npick up the red block\n[PLAN END]\n\n[VERIFICATION]\nThe above plan is invalid.
